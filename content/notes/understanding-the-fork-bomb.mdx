A **fork bomb** is one of the simplest yet most destructive DoS attacks against Unix-like systems. It rapidly creates new processes until the system runs out of resources and freezes.

The classic form looks like this:

```bash path=null start=null
:(){ :|:& };:
```

Yeah, that's it. Let's break down what this cryptic line actually does.

## 🧬 Anatomy of the Fork Bomb

### Function Definition: `:()`

This defines a function named `:` (yes, just a colon). While unconventional, this is valid in Bash.

### Function Body: `{ :|:& };`

The function body contains:

```bash path=null start=null
:|:&
```

- `:` calls itself.
- `|` pipes its output into another call to itself.
- `&` sends both calls to the background, allowing the parent to continue and spawn more.

This means **each function call spawns two new ones**, exponentially increasing the number of processes.

Finally, `;:` **calls the function once**, kicking off the chain reaction.

## 🌱 Process Tree Growth

The process tree grows exponentially:

```
:()                    (1 process)
├── Child 1            (2 processes)
│   ├── Grandchild 1   (4 processes)
│   └── Grandchild 2
└── Child 2
    ├── Grandchild 3
    └── Grandchild 4
```

Each generation doubles the number of processes. This rapidly depletes system resources.

## ⚙️ Fork Bomb Execution Flow

**The cycle:**

1. Define function `:()`
2. Call function `:`
3. Fork two background processes
4. Each process repeats the function
5. Repeat until system runs out of resources

This continues until the system freezes.

## 🖥️ What Happens When You Run It?

Running this code will:

1. **Define the function**.
2. **Call the function once**, which forks twice.
3. Each of those forks **forks two more**, and so on.

This exponential growth rapidly overwhelms the process table, starving the system of resources and effectively freezing it.

## 🛡️ How to Protect Against It

1. **Limit user processes** with `ulimit`:

```bash path=null start=null
ulimit -u 100
```

2. **Use cgroups (control groups)** for fine-grained resource control on Linux systems.

3. **Audit shell scripts** and educate users about the risks of executing unknown code.

## ⚠️ Warning

Never run the fork bomb on a production system. It will almost certainly require a hard reboot. Always test destructive code in a **controlled environment** like a virtual machine.

## 🔚 Final Thoughts

The fork bomb is a powerful demonstration of how minimal code can wreak havoc. While it's often used as a teaching example or prank, it’s a serious tool that underscores the importance of resource management and shell security.

Stay safe — and stay curious.
