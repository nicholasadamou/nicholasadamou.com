In the rapidly evolving landscape of web-based tools, **Squash** stands out as a modern, high-performance image compression tool that runs entirely in the browser. Built on a foundation of **WebAssembly** and a modular architecture, Squash offers fast, efficient compression for multiple image formats without compromising on quality. This article delves into the **low-level system design**, **architecture**, and **key design decisions** that make Squash a powerful and scalable solution.

## Table of Contents

## Why Squash Was Created

The inspiration for **Squash** arose from the need for **an intuitive, privacy-first image compression solution** that could be used anywhere—without the overhead of server-side processing or third-party dependencies. I often found myself switching between multiple tools to optimize images for various purposes: web development, presentations, and personal projects. While some tools provided excellent compression results, they required **uploading images to external servers**, raising concerns about **privacy** and **data control**. Others were powerful but felt unnecessarily complex for everyday tasks.

The question became clear:
**What if we could compress images directly in the browser, with near-native performance and complete user control?**

With advances in **WebAssembly (WASM)** and modern frontend frameworks like **React**, building such a tool was not only possible but could also deliver **blazing-fast performance** without compromising the user experience. Squash was born out of the desire to create a tool that meets the following core goals:

- **Speed and Performance**: Utilize WebAssembly to achieve native-like image processing speed.
- **Privacy and Security**: Ensure that all image processing happens on the client side, with no server involvement.
- **Simplicity and Usability**: Provide a minimal, intuitive interface that doesn’t overwhelm users with technical jargon.
- **Extendability**: Build a modular architecture that makes it easy to add new formats and compression techniques.

Squash bridges the gap between **powerful image compression algorithms** and a **user-friendly experience**, making it a go-to tool for developers, designers, and casual users alike. Whether you need to shrink large image assets for web deployment or just want to reduce the size of vacation photos before sharing them, Squash handles it all—quickly and securely.

## 📚 High-Level Architecture

Squash follows a **modular, component-based architecture** that makes it easy to extend and maintain. The core system is divided into three primary layers:

1. **React Frontend**
   The user interface (UI) built with **React** and **TypeScript** provides a clean, responsive experience. **Framer Motion** is used to add animations, enhancing the UX.

2. **Compression Engine**
   The core compression logic is powered by **WebAssembly** for near-native performance. The engine handles decoding, compressing, and encoding images using a set of WebAssembly-based codecs.

3. **State Management and Queueing**
   Custom hooks (`useImageManager` and `useImageQueue`) manage image states and processing queues, ensuring smooth, parallelized processing without blocking the UI.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor User
participant "React UI" as React
participant "Compression Options" as Options
participant "WebAssembly Compression" as WASM
participant "Codecs" as Codecs
React -> Options: Select Format & Quality
Options -> WASM: Start Compression
WASM -> Codecs: Load and Compress Image
Codecs --> WASM: Compressed Data
WASM --> React: Return Compressed Image

```

## 🛠️ Low-Level System Design

The **low-level system design** revolves around WebAssembly modules for handling image processing. This allows Squash to achieve:

- **Native-like Performance**: WebAssembly provides near-native speed, significantly faster than JavaScript-based image processing.
- **Modular Codec Support**: Each codec (AVIF, JPEG, JPEG XL, PNG, WebP) is a separate WebAssembly module, making it easy to add or update codecs.
- **Client-Side Processing**: No images are sent to the server, ensuring **privacy** and **security** while reducing network latency.

### Key System Components:

1. **Compression Options Component**
Manages format selection and quality settings. Uses **default quality settings** optimized for each format.

```ts
const DEFAULT_QUALITY_SETTINGS = {
  avif: 50,
  jpeg: 75,
  jxl: 75,
  webp: 75,
};
   ```

2. **WebAssembly Compression Engine**
- Dynamically loads the required WebAssembly codec.
- Decodes and encodes images using optimized buffer handling to minimize memory overhead.
- Supports parallel image processing with a smart queuing system.

3. **State Management with React Hooks**
- `useImageManager`: Manages image states (pending, queued, processing, complete).
- `useImageQueue`: Handles the compression queue, ensuring that only a limited number of images are processed simultaneously.

## 🔄 Workflow and Image Processing

The image compression workflow in Squash is designed to be asynchronous and highly efficient. The process begins when a user uploads or drags images into the **DropZone** component. Each image undergoes validation and is added to the processing queue.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor User
User -> DropZone: Upload/Drag Images
DropZone -> CompressionEngine: Add to Queue
CompressionEngine -> WASM: Decode & Compress
WASM --> CompressionEngine: Compressed Data
CompressionEngine -> User: Display Preview
User -> CompressionEngine: Download or Clear
@enduml
```

The **Compression Engine** processes each image through a multi-step pipeline:

1. **Validation**: Ensures the image is in a supported format.
2. **Decoding**: The image is decoded into raw pixel data using the appropriate WebAssembly codec.
3. **Compression**: The pixel data is compressed into the desired format with the specified quality settings.
4. **Preview Generation**: A preview of the compressed image is displayed.
5. **Download Management**: The compressed image is available for download individually or in a batch as a ZIP file.

## ⚙️ Design Decisions

Several important design decisions were made to balance performance, scalability, and user experience:

### 1. **WebAssembly for Performance**
Using WebAssembly for image processing ensures fast and efficient operations, especially for computationally expensive tasks like compression and format conversion.

### 2. **Client-Side Processing for Privacy**
By keeping all image processing on the client side, Squash eliminates concerns about uploading sensitive images to external servers. This also reduces network latency and enhances performance.

### 3. **Component-Based Design**
Squash leverages React’s component model to maintain a clean separation of concerns. Each component (e.g., `DropZone`, `CompressionOptions`, `ImageList`) is self-contained and reusable.

### 4. **Parallel Processing with Smart Queuing**
The compression engine limits the number of concurrent tasks to avoid blocking the main thread. This ensures a smooth user experience, even when processing large batches of images.

### 5. **Tailwind CSS for Styling**
Tailwind CSS provides utility-based styling, ensuring a consistent and maintainable design without writing custom CSS from scratch.

## 📦 CI/CD with GitHub Actions and Vercel

**Squash** uses a **CI/CD pipeline** powered by **GitHub Actions** for continuous integration and **Vercel** for seamless deployment. This combination ensures that every change is automatically tested and deployed to production without manual intervention, promoting an efficient and reliable development workflow.

### CI/CD Pipeline Workflow

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Developer
participant "GitHub Repository" as GitHubRepo
participant "GitHub Actions" as GitHubActions
participant "Testing Framework (Jest)" as Jest
participant "Vite Build System" as Vite
participant "Vercel Deployment" as Vercel

Developer -> GitHubRepo: Push Code / Create Pull Request
GitHubRepo -> GitHubActions: Trigger CI Workflow

GitHubActions -> Jest: Run Unit Tests
Jest --> GitHubActions: Report Test Results (Success/Failure)

GitHubActions -> Vite: Build Production Application
Vite --> GitHubActions: Build Status (Success/Failure)

alt All Steps Passed
  GitHubActions -> Vercel: Deploy Build to Production
  Vercel --> Developer: Deployment Success Notification
else Tests/Build Failed
  GitHubActions --> Developer: CI Failure Notification
end
