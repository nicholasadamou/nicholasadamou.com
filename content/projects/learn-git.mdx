**Learn Git** is a free and open-source platform designed to help beginners master Git with ease. Built using modern web technologies, this platform provides an accessible and intuitive learning experience for those new to version control.

## Why Build _Learn Git_?

Version control is a fundamental skill for developers, but many beginners struggle to grasp Git concepts due to complex documentation and steep learning curves. I built **Learn Git** to provide an intuitive, structured, and beginner-friendly platform for mastering Git. By leveraging modern web technologies and a well-organized architecture, this site ensures a seamless learning experience while maintaining high performance and accessibility.

## Objectives
- Provide a beginner-friendly learning platform for Git and GitHub.
- Offer structured and interactive documentation.
- Ensure the platform is visually appealing and easy to navigate.
- Optimize performance and accessibility for a seamless learning experience.

## Solution
Learn Git was developed as an intuitive, documentation-driven web application. The platform leverages the power of **Next.js** for dynamic content delivery, **MDX** for rich documentation, and **Tailwind CSS** with **Shadcn/ui** and **MagicUI** for a sleek, modern UI.

### Key Features
1. **Comprehensive Git Learning Modules**
- Covers essential Git commands and workflows.
- Hands-on examples with step-by-step guidance.

2. **Interactive UI & Modern Design**
- Built with **Shadcn/ui** and **MagicUI** for reusable components.
- Uses **Magic UI** for enhanced interactivity and animations.

3. **Performance & Deployment**
- Deployed on **Vercel** for scalability and speed.
- Utilizes **Vercel Analytics** for real-time performance monitoring.

4. **Code Quality & Maintainability**
- TypeScript ensures type safety across the application.
- **ESLint** and **Prettier** enforce coding standards.

## Technical Architecture
The project is structured using a modular and scalable approach. The core components include:

- **Frontend:** Next.js with a structured app directory.
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling.
- **Data Handling:** MDX for rendering documentation content.
- **State Management:** React Hooks for interactive elements.
- **Deployment:** Vercel for hosting and continuous deployment.

## Architectural Design Principles

The system follows these key principles:

### 1. **Modularity & Reusability**
The application is designed with reusable components and modular architecture:
- **Component-Based Design:** UI elements, markdown rendering, and interactive animations are separate, making them easily maintainable.
- **Hooks for State Management:** Custom React hooks provide efficient state management and encapsulated logic.

### 2. **Scalability & Performance Optimization**
To ensure fast load times and seamless interactions:
- **Static Site Generation (SSG):** Next.js pre-renders documentation pages for optimal performance.
- **Code Splitting & Lazy Loading:** Only necessary components load when required, reducing initial page load times.

### 3. **Enhanced Developer Experience**
- **Type Safety with TypeScript:** Prevents runtime errors and improves code maintainability.
- **Linting & Formatting:** ESLint and Prettier ensure consistent coding standards.
- **CI/CD with GitHub Actions:** Automates testing and deployment for streamlined development.

## Canvas Cursor Effect on Landing Page ðŸ¤¯

The **Canvas Cursor Component** is a React-based interactive effect that creates a dynamic, animated trailing effect following the user's cursor. It utilizes HTML5 Canvas and a physics-based approach to simulate fluid motion. The component consists of:
- **CanvasCursor Component**: Manages rendering of the canvas.
- **useCanvasCursor Hook**: Handles animation logic.
- **Oscillator & Line Classes**: Control physics-based movement.

### Component Structure

```plantuml
component CanvasCursor {
    CanvasCursor --> useCanvasCursor : Uses
    useCanvasCursor --> Canvas : Initializes
    useCanvasCursor --> "Lines Array" : Controls
    useCanvasCursor --> "Event Listeners" : Handles
    "Lines Array" --> Nodes : Contains
    "Lines Array" --> "Physics Engine" : Updated by
    "Physics Engine" --> Oscillator : Uses
}
```

#### **CanvasCursor Component**

- Determines if the user is on a mobile device and conditionally renders the canvas.
- Uses the `useCanvasCursor` hook to apply animations.

#### **useCanvasCursor Hook**

- Initializes the canvas, sets event listeners, and starts the animation loop.
- Updates the canvas by applying physics rules on multiple **Lines**.

#### **Line Class**

- Represents a flexible, physics-based entity that follows the cursor.
- Uses **Nodes** to create a trailing effect.

#### **Oscillator Class**

- Generates smooth, sine-wave-based variations for stroke color over time.

### Event Flow

The Canvas Cursor effect follows this event flow:

```plantuml
participant User
participant CanvasCursor
participant useCanvasCursor
participant Canvas
participant Lines
participant Nodes

User -> CanvasCursor : Loads Component
CanvasCursor -> useCanvasCursor : Calls Hook
useCanvasCursor -> Canvas : Initializes Canvas
useCanvasCursor -> Lines : Creates Lines
User -> Canvas : Moves Cursor
Canvas -> Lines : Updates Positions
Lines -> Nodes : Applies Physics
Nodes -> Canvas : Renders Updated Positions

loop Animation Loop
    useCanvasCursor -> Canvas : Clears and Redraws
    Canvas -> Lines : Updates Each Frame
end
```

## State & Behavior

The Canvas Cursor effect transitions through various states and behaviors:

```plantuml
[*] --> Initializing
Initializing --> Running : Canvas Initialized
Running --> Updating : Mouse Moves
Running --> Resizing : Window Resizes
Updating --> Rendering : Draw Updated Nodes
Resizing --> Running : Adjust Canvas Size
Rendering --> Running : Loop Continues
Running --> [*] : Unmount Cleanup
```

### Key Features

Some key features of the Canvas Cursor effect include:

- **Physics-Based Animation**: Uses a spring-mass system for smooth motion.
- **Dynamic Trail Effect**: Lines update their positions based on cursor movements.
- **Color Oscillation**: Stroke color continuously changes using the `Oscillator` class.
- **Optimized Rendering**: Uses `requestAnimationFrame` to ensure smooth performance.
- **Mobile Detection**: Disables the effect on mobile devices for usability.
