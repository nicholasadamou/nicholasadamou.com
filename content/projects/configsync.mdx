## Introduction

Let's be real—managing application configurations across multiple Mac systems is a pain. Setting up a new development machine? Tedious. Keeping settings consistent across your team? Error-prone. Worried about losing your carefully tweaked configurations? You should be.

**ConfigSync** fixes all of that. It's a command-line tool that centralizes, manages, and synchronizes your macOS application settings across multiple systems. Smart auto-discovery finds your configs automatically, safe deployment mechanisms ensure nothing breaks, and robust backup systems mean you can always roll back. Configuration management goes from being a chore to just... handled.

## Why ConfigSync?

ConfigSync tackles the real pain points of macOS configuration management:

### The Problem

Your development environment is a mess of config files scattered everywhere. VS Code settings here, iTerm2 preferences there, SSH configs somewhere else, Git settings in another spot. Dozens of apps, dozens of locations. Keeping all of that synchronized across multiple machines without proper tooling? Absolute nightmare.

### The Solution: Consistency

ConfigSync keeps your development environment consistent whether you're on your main machine, a fresh laptop, or helping a teammate get set up. It stores everything in one centralized location and uses symlinks, so any changes you make to application settings are immediately reflected everywhere.

### The Safety Net

This isn't just copying files around. ConfigSync provides comprehensive backup mechanisms, checksum validation, and rollback capabilities. Every operation gets logged, and the system runs integrity checks to make sure your configurations stay intact and recoverable.

## Core Architecture

ConfigSync's architecture is built around six key components:

**ConfigSync Core:**

- **Configuration Registry**: Tracks what's being managed
- **Central Storage**: Where all your configs actually live
- **Symlink Manager**: Creates and maintains symlinks to the central storage
- **Backup System**: Handles versioned backups with checksums
- **Deployment Engine**: Pushes configs to new systems
- **App Detector**: Automatically discovers installed applications

**System Integration:**
The Symlink Manager connects to all the major macOS config locations:

- `~/Library/Preferences/` - App preferences (plist files)
- `~/Library/Application Support/` - App data and settings
- `~/.config/` - Unix-style configuration files
- `~/Library/Containers/` - Sandboxed app data
- `~/Library/Group Containers/` - Shared app configurations

**Supported Applications:**
Out of the box, ConfigSync knows how to handle Visual Studio Code, Google Chrome, iTerm2, 1Password, Git & SSH, and 20+ more applications.

**CLI Interface:**
Everything happens through simple commands: `init`, `discover`, `sync`, `backup`, `export`, and `deploy`.

### Directory Structure

ConfigSync organizes everything in `~/.configsync/` with a clean, logical structure:

**`config.yaml`** - The main configuration registry tracking all managed applications

**`store/`** - Central storage mirroring your system directory structure:

- `Library/Preferences/` - App preference files (VS Code, Chrome, iTerm2 plists)
- `Library/Application Support/` - App data directories (Code/, Google/Chrome/, Alfred/)
- `Containers/` - Sandboxed app data (1Password, etc.)
- `.config/` - Unix-style configs (git/, ssh/)

**`backups/`** - Versioned snapshots with checksums for safe rollback
**`logs/`** - Operation logs for debugging and audit trails
**`temp/`** - Staging area for export/import operations

## Dynamic Application Discovery & Configuration Management

ConfigSync's most innovative feature is its intelligent, multi-layered discovery system that automatically identifies installed applications and dynamically locates their configuration files across macOS's complex directory structure. Unlike static configuration tools that rely on hardcoded paths, ConfigSync adapts to each system's unique setup and application versions.

### Multi-Method Discovery Engine

ConfigSync employs a sophisticated discovery engine that combines multiple detection methods to ensure comprehensive application coverage:

#### 1. System Profiler Integration

ConfigSync leverages macOS's built-in `system_profiler` command to enumerate all installed applications with comprehensive metadata:

```bash path=null start=null
# ConfigSync internally executes commands like:
system_profiler SPApplicationsDataType -json
```

This provides:

- Application bundle identifiers (e.g., `com.microsoft.VSCode`)
- Installation paths and versions
- Application signatures and metadata
- Launch services registration data

#### 2. Spotlight Search Integration

Using `mdfind` (Spotlight's command-line interface), ConfigSync performs intelligent searches across the entire filesystem:

```bash path=null start=null
# Search for application bundles
mdfind "kMDItemContentType == 'com.apple.application-bundle'"

# Find specific app configurations
mdfind "kMDItemDisplayName == 'Visual Studio Code'"
```

#### 3. Intelligent Directory Scanning

ConfigSync systematically scans known application installation directories with recursive pattern matching:

- `/Applications` - Standard app installations
- `~/Applications` - User-specific applications
- `/System/Applications` - System applications
- `/System/Library/CoreServices` - Core system utilities
- `/usr/local/bin` - Command-line tools and utilities

### Dynamic Configuration Pattern Detection

Once applications are discovered, ConfigSync employs advanced pattern recognition to locate their configuration files across macOS's diverse storage locations:

```plantuml
@startuml Configuration Discovery Flow
!theme plain

start

:Discovered Application\n(e.g., Visual Studio Code);

partition "Bundle Analysis" {
  :Extract Bundle ID\n(com.microsoft.VSCode);
  :Read Info.plist metadata;
  :Identify app version & signature;
}

partition "Configuration Search" {
  :Search ~/Library/Preferences/\nfor bundle-specific .plist files;
  :Scan ~/Library/Application Support/\nfor app data directories;
  :Check ~/Library/Containers/\nfor sandboxed app data;
  :Look in ~/Library/Group Containers/\nfor shared app configurations;
  :Search ~/.config/ and ~/.* \nfor Unix-style dotfiles;
}

partition "Pattern Matching" {
  if (Bundle ID patterns?) then (found)
    :Match com.company.app.* patterns;
  endif
  if (App name patterns?) then (found)
    :Match case-insensitive app names;
  endif
  if (Known config patterns?) then (found)
    :Apply built-in app rules;
  endif
}

:Validate Configuration Files;

if (Files accessible?) then (yes)
  :Create Configuration Profile;
  :Store in Registry;
else (no)
  :Log Permission Issues;
  :Mark as Partially Supported;
endif

stop

@enduml
```

### Smart Configuration Storage Strategy

ConfigSync doesn't just copy configuration files—it intelligently categorizes and stores them based on their type and importance:

#### Configuration File Classification

1. **Core Preferences (.plist files)**

   ```bash path=null start=null
   # Example: Visual Studio Code preferences
   ~/Library/Preferences/com.microsoft.VSCode.plist → ~/.configsync/store/Library/Preferences/
   ```

2. **Application Support Data**

   ```bash path=null start=null
   # Example: VS Code extensions and settings
   ~/Library/Application Support/Code/ → ~/.configsync/store/Library/Application Support/Code/
   ```

3. **Sandboxed App Containers**

   ```bash path=null start=null
   # Example: 1Password app data
   ~/Library/Containers/com.1password.1password/ → ~/.configsync/store/Containers/com.1password.1password/
   ```

4. **XDG Configuration Directories**
   ```bash path=null start=null
   # Example: Git and SSH configurations
   ~/.config/git/ → ~/.configsync/store/.config/git/
   ~/.ssh/ → ~/.configsync/store/.config/ssh/
   ```

### Advanced Discovery Process

```plantuml
@startuml Enhanced Discovery Process Flow
!theme plain

start

:User runs **configsync discover**;

partition "Phase 1: System Enumeration" {
  :System Profiler Scan\n(All installed apps);
  :Spotlight Search\n(Deep filesystem scan);
  :Directory Scanning\n(Known app locations);
  :CLI Tool Detection\n(Command-line utilities);
}

:Merge and Deduplicate Results;

partition "Phase 2: Configuration Mapping" {
  while (For each discovered app) is (more apps)
    :Extract app metadata\n(bundle ID, version, path);
    :Apply configuration rules\n(built-in patterns);
    :Search known config locations;
    :Validate file accessibility;
    :Detect permission requirements;
  endwhile (complete)
}

partition "Phase 3: Storage Classification" {
  :Categorize by config type\n(prefs, app support, containers);
  :Calculate storage requirements;
  :Identify symlink targets;
  :Generate backup strategies;
}

partition "Phase 4: Registry Update" {
  :Create app configuration profiles;
  :Update ~/.configsync/config.yaml;
  :Log discovery results;
  :Generate recommendations;
}

if (--list flag?) then (yes)
  :Display Comprehensive Table\nwith paths and status;
  stop
elseif (--auto-add flag?) then (yes)
  :Automatically Add All Discovered;
  :Create Symlink Structure;
  :Initialize Backups;
  stop
elseif (--filter specified?) then (yes)
  :Apply Advanced Filtering\n(name, type, status);
  :Show Filtered Results;
  stop
else (default)
  :Show Discovery Summary\nwith statistics;
  stop
endif

```

### Intelligent Storage & Symlink Management

ConfigSync's storage system goes beyond simple file copying by implementing intelligent symlink management that maintains live connections between applications and their centralized configurations:

#### Symlink Strategy by Configuration Type

```plantuml
@startuml Storage and Symlink Strategy
!theme plain

package "Original Locations" as ORIG {
  [~/Library/Preferences/\ncom.app.plist] as PREF_ORIG
  [~/Library/Application Support/\nAppName/] as APPS_ORIG
  [~/Library/Containers/\ncom.app.bundle/] as CONT_ORIG
  [~/.config/appname/] as XDG_ORIG
}

package "ConfigSync Central Store" as STORE {
  [~/.configsync/store/Library/Preferences/\ncom.app.plist] as PREF_STORE
  [~/.configsync/store/Library/Application Support/\nAppName/] as APPS_STORE
  [~/.configsync/store/Containers/\ncom.app.bundle/] as CONT_STORE
  [~/.configsync/store/.config/\nappname/] as XDG_STORE
}

package "Backup System" as BACKUP {
  [~/.configsync/backups/\n2024-09-19-14-30-45/] as BACKUP_DIR
  [checksums.yaml] as CHECKSUMS
}

PREF_ORIG -.-> PREF_STORE : symlink
APPS_ORIG -.-> APPS_STORE : symlink
CONT_ORIG -.-> CONT_STORE : symlink
XDG_ORIG -.-> XDG_STORE : symlink

PREF_STORE --> BACKUP_DIR : backup copy
APPS_STORE --> BACKUP_DIR : backup copy
CONT_STORE --> BACKUP_DIR : backup copy
XDG_STORE --> BACKUP_DIR : backup copy

BACKUP_DIR --> CHECKSUMS : validation

note right of PREF_ORIG
  Applications read/write
  to original locations
  transparently
end note

note left of STORE
  Central store maintains
  actual configuration files
  with version control ready
end note

note bottom of BACKUP
  Timestamped backups with
  integrity verification
  before any changes
end note

@enduml
```

#### Dynamic Configuration Rules Engine

ConfigSync uses a sophisticated rules engine to determine how different types of applications should be handled:

```yaml path=null start=null
# Example from ConfigSync's internal rules
applications:
  "Visual Studio Code":
    bundle_id: "com.microsoft.VSCode"
    config_paths:
      - path: "~/Library/Preferences/com.microsoft.VSCode.plist"
        type: "preferences"
        critical: true
      - path: "~/Library/Application Support/Code/User/settings.json"
        type: "user_settings"
        critical: true
      - path: "~/Library/Application Support/Code/User/keybindings.json"
        type: "keybindings"
        critical: false
    backup_strategy: "full"
    symlink_mode: "file_level"
```

#### Adaptive Configuration Detection

ConfigSync adapts to different application architectures and storage patterns:

1. **Legacy Applications** (Pre-sandboxing)
   - Direct preference files in `~/Library/Preferences/`
   - Application support in `~/Library/Application Support/`
   - Simple bundle ID-based detection

2. **Sandboxed Applications** (Modern macOS apps)
   - Isolated containers in `~/Library/Containers/`
   - Group containers for shared data
   - Complex permission handling

3. **Cross-Platform Applications**
   - XDG-compliant configurations in `~/.config/`
   - Dotfiles in home directory
   - Multi-platform compatibility considerations

4. **Command-Line Tools**
   - Configuration files in `~/.config/toolname/`
   - Dotfiles like `.gitconfig`, `.zshrc`
   - Tool-specific discovery patterns

### Supported Applications with Dynamic Discovery

### Real-Time Configuration Tracking

ConfigSync doesn't just manage static configurations—it provides real-time tracking and monitoring of configuration changes across all managed applications:

#### Configuration Registry Deep Dive

The `~/.configsync/config.yaml` file serves as the central registry, containing detailed metadata about each managed application:

```yaml path=null start=null
# ConfigSync Configuration Registry Example
version: "1.0"
last_updated: "2024-09-19T14:30:45Z"
system_info:
  hostname: "MacBook-Pro"

        size_bytes: 2048
        checksum_sha256: "a1b2c3d4e5f6..."
        symlink_status: "active"
        backup_count: 5
      - path: "~/Library/Application Support/Code/User/settings.json"
        type: "user_settings"
        size_bytes: 15672
        checksum_sha256: "f6e5d4c3b2a1..."
        symlink_status: "active"
        last_modified: "2024-09-19T12:45:15Z"

  git:
    display_name: "Git"
    type: "cli_tool"
    version: "2.42.0"
    status: "active"
    configurations:
      - path: "~/.gitconfig"
        type: "global_config"
        symlink_status: "active"
        contains_secrets: false
      - path: "~/.ssh/config"
        type: "ssh_config"
        symlink_status: "active"
        contains_secrets: true
        backup_encryption: true
```

#### Intelligent Change Detection

ConfigSync monitors configuration changes through multiple mechanisms:

```plantuml
@startuml Configuration Change Detection
!theme plain

start

:Application modifies config file;

partition "Detection Methods" {
  if (File system events?) then (detected)
    :macOS FSEvents notification;
  elseif (Periodic checksum scan?) then (changed)
    :SHA256 hash comparison;
  elseif (Manual sync trigger?) then (requested)
    :User runs configsync sync;
  endif
}

:Calculate file differences;

if (Significant changes?) then (yes)
  partition "Backup Process" {
    :Create timestamped backup;
    :Generate checksums;
    :Update backup registry;
  }

  partition "Sync Process" {
    :Update central store;
    :Refresh symlinks if needed;
    :Update configuration registry;
  }

  :Log change details;
  :Notify user if requested;
else (no)
  :Skip unnecessary operations;
endif

stop

@enduml
```

## Configuration Sync Process

The synchronization process is the heart of ConfigSync, ensuring that all managed applications maintain consistent configurations through safe symlink management:

```plantuml
@startuml Sync Process Flow
!theme plain

start

:User runs **configsync sync**;

if (Config file exists?) then (no)
  :❌ Error: Run 'configsync init' first;
  stop
else (yes)
  :📋 Load configuration registry;
endif

:🔍 Get enabled apps from config;

while (More apps to process?) is (yes)
  :📂 Check application paths;

  if (Required path missing?) then (yes)
    :⚠️ Warn: Required path missing;
  else (no)
    if (Backup enabled?) then (yes)
      :📦 Create timestamped backup;
      if (Backup successful?) then (no)
        :❌ Log backup failure;
      else (yes)
        :🔒 Generate checksums;
        :🔗 Create/update symlink;
        if (Symlink successful?) then (yes)
          :📝 Update config status;
          :📊 Log success metrics;
        else (no)
          :❌ Log symlink failure;
        endif
      endif
    else (no)
      :🔗 Create/update symlink;
      :📝 Update config status;
    endif
  endif
endwhile (no)

:📈 Generate sync summary;
:🗂️ Update operation logs;
